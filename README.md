# Flash Cards App v2


> A flashcard or flash card (also known as an index card) is a card bearing information on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an answer on the other. Flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical dates, formulas or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Here I've tried to implement something similar in the form of a web app.

Steps to use the app:

*    Download the zip and extract the "Flash-Cards-Project".

*    Using pip or any similar package, download all the required Python packages mentioned in the "requirements.txt" 
     (or) run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" on your terminal/command line us to download all the required packages.

*    Open your termial/command line inside the project folder and run the command "python main.py" to start the application.

*    Open the url show on your terminal/command line to open the application on your browser. 

*    Start using the app by either logging in or registering for an account.

*    Happy learning :) !

*    Or, just go to  https://flash-cards-project.mohnish7.repl.co/ to use the previous version

> **NOTE**: Since I've used *SQLite3* database in this project, users won't be able to store their stuff permanently in the database.
